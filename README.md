The Argument Clinic
==

This plugin defines movements between arguments in an comma-separated argument list (or comma separated [] and {} constructs). It also defines two operations: putting a register as an argument, either before or after the argument under the cursor, adding comma plus whitespace as needed. And conversely, an operation that deleties an argument, only yanking the argument code to the register, and discarding the comma and whitespace.
